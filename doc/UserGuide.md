## 1.1  PuMuKIT’s overview 

### 1.1.1 Terminology

-   **Series**: Ordered collection of multimedia objects.

-   **Multimedia Objects**: Set of multimedia content, metadata and materials obtained from recording an event. The multimedia object are composed by:
	
    - Several multimedia files: the storage copy with maximum quality (designed as master) and one or several distribution copies with different qualities or codecs.

    - Descriptive metadata, temporal and spatial location metadata, style metadata and access to multimedia object metadata.

    - Metadata to catalogue multimedia object.

    - Metadata of the people that take part in the multimedia object and their roles.

    - Attached materials and URLs that complete the content of the multimedia object.

-   **Web-TV:** The website generated by PuMuKIT.

-   **Metadata:**Editable information of a multimedia object (title, subtitle, keyword, copyright, genre, publish date, recording date, description).

-   **Modules:**Different sections that include PuMuKIT.

-   **ARCA-RSS:** The second publication mode. This data stream format RSS-ARCA generated by PuMuKIT allows that the database with all the audio-visual contents of our institution join a central database, the ARCA server.

### 1.1.2 What is PuMuKIT?

PuMuKIT is an application which can create Web-Tv portals thanks to a powerful backend of administration. PuMuKIT is a platform which allows you to automate the publication process of audiovisual contents produced by an institution or University through the Internet.

PuMuKIT publishes multimedia content stored in its database through different publishing channels such as Web-Tv Portals, different RSS feeds, sites in iTunesU, channels in YouTube or Dspace sites.

The **multimedia object** is the main key of the Web-Tv. This is a set of multimedia contents, its metadata and attached materials obtained from recording an event. Multimedia objects are composed of:

-   Several multimedia files: the storage copy with maximum quality (designed as master) and one or several distribution copies with different qualities or codecs.

-   Descriptive metadata, temporal and spatial localization metadata, style metadata and access to multimedia object metadata.

-   Metadata to catalogue multimedia objects.

-   Metadata of the people that take part in the multimedia object and their roles.

-   Attached materials and URLs that complete the content of the multimedia object.

Multimedia objects with a common topic are gathered in series. A series can be considered as an organized collection of multimedia objects. ***All multimedia objects belong to a series***.

The Web TV application is made up of several applications:

-   **FRONTEND**: Public portal where users can surf the series and see
    the videos. (http://{MyPuMuKIT\_IP}/)

-   **BACKEND**: Private portal of administration where multimedia
    contents of the database are catalogued and published. It also
    allows you to modify the configuration and appearance of the Web
    portal. (http://{MyPuMuKIT\_IP}/admin)

**Figure PuMuKit’s backend**

The backend, or application of administration, is a modular Web and an interactive application with two main functions: administrating and cataloguing. It has a private access. Thus, it’s necessary to be registered and to initialize a session. Due to these two functions, the backend is used by two types of users:

-   **Content administrator**: he is in charge of configuring the users with access and their priorities, the real-time channels, the news and the design of the Web portal.

-   **Publisher**: he is in charge of administrating the series and multimedia objects employed as sources in the application of publication.

This application is divided into independent modules. These modules can have a section associated and share a common layout. This layout contains a header, an access menu to different modules and a link to logging off and closes the application.
